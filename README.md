### FAQ

* Will I get banned for using this ?

No. This is using [Game State Integration](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Counter-Strike:_Global_Offensive_Game_State_Integration), which is allowed by Valve.

* Does it work in matchmaking ? On faceit ?

Yes.

* How do I add my own sounds ?

Yes. Just drop them in the corresponding `sounds` folder.

As of right now, only OPUS files are supported. More formats will come soon.

Feel free to remove the ones you don't like, too.
